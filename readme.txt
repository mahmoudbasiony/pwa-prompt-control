== Description ==
90% of consumers say that online reviews impact their purchase decision. The Reviewshake plugin helps you stand out on Wordpress with the best reviews from a multitude of sources.

Our plugin allows you to display reviews from 80+ review websites with a very simple and intuitive interface. You just need to add the review sources, and then you can set up your plugin. Unlike most other plugins that focus on 1 or 2 review sources, we cover almost all the major review sources, including the most popular ones like Google, Facebook or Yelp (the full list of review sources is shown below).

After adding the review sources with a few clicks, you can set up your widgets right away, and you can embed them in your blog\'s header, footer or sidebar using the Appearance section.If you already have a Reviewshake account, you can connect it using your subdomain and API key.Reviewshake is an end-to-end solution for generating and managing reviews in order to drive up conversions and increase sales. This plugin covers only a small part of our features. You can find out more about our product here.
