This plugin allows you to add reviews widgets to show your business reviews. It includes Google reviews, Facebook reviews, Yelp reviews, Expedia Reviews and 80+ other reviews websites.

== Description ==
The Reviewshake plugin allows you to display reviews from 80+ review websites with a very simple and intuitive interface. You just need to add the reviews sources, and then you can set up your widgets. Unlike most other plugins that focus on 1 or 2 reviews sources, we cover almost all the major reviews sources, including the most popular ones like Google reviews, Facebook reviews or Yelp reviews (the full list of review sources is shown below).

= How it works =

After adding the reviews sources with a few clicks, you can set up your widgets right away, and you can embed them in your blog's header, footer or sidebar using the Appearance section. After that, your reviews widgets will be visible on your website. If you already have a Reviewshake account, you can connect it using your subdomain and API key and all your business reviews and existing widgets will show up automatically. Reviewshake is an end-to-end solution for generating and managing business reviews in order to drive up conversions and increase sales. This plugin covers only a small part of our features. You can find out more about our products [here](https://www.reviewshake.com/).
